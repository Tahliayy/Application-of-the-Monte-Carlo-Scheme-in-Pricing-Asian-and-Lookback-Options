# Application-of-the-Monte-Carlo-Scheme-in-Pricing-Asian-and-Lookback-Options
In this report, I will explore the application of the Monte Carlo scheme to price exotic options, focusing specifically on Asian and lookback options. I will use the expected value of the discounted payoff under the risk-neutral density for the appropriate form of payoff to assess these options. This approach involves simulating the underlying stock price initially using the Euler-Maruyama method, starting with a scenario where today's stock price is 100, the strike is also 100, with a time to expiry of one year, volatility at 20%, and a constant risk-free interest rate of 5%. I will vary the input data to observe its effects on the option prices. The report will outline the financial problem and numerical procedures used, present the results through tables and comparisons, discuss any interesting observations and challenges encountered, and conclude with a summary of the findings.
